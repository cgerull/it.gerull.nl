# Usefull development tools

These are my development tools for the different platforms I use.

I mostly development scripts and tools in Python or Javascript. My IDE of choice is Visual Studio Code because it covers all languages I need. You even get a decent milage with Java. 

However when working on a specific Java project I use IntelliJ IDEA. You find it at [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)

## Common

### Visual Studio Code
You find installers for all 3 platforms at [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## MacOs

### Git
MacOS has a resonable recent Git client.

If you want the latest go to [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/) and download the MacOS installer package to get the latest Git version.

### Python

Download the installer of Python 3 from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### NodeJS

### Docker

## Linux (Ubuntu Desktop)

### Git

Install a recent version via `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git`.

### Python

Python 3 should be in the base package. To develop with Python you need pip3 and virtual environment as well. Just install it via `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-virtualenvironment` 

Other packages can be installed via pip.
